# VGA Donut

![preview](preview.png)

## How it works

Renders a faceted donut to a VGA monitor.

Interestingly, it is not actually rendering any polygons; this is sphere traced
(AKA raymarched), using a CORDIC unit to calculate the distance between a point
and the surface of the torus. But, because we don't have much time (we're
racing the VGA beam!), we do just two CORDIC iterations, which causes the donut
surface to actually become polyhedral. This trick was [accidentally discovered
by Bruno Levy](https://x.com/BrunoLevy01/status/1718674786954399798) while
playing with a C version of my original donut code and I had to try it out in
Verilog -- so here we are.

The reason it has such low horizontal resolution is because it's doing 16 ray
marching steps per "pixel", with four CORDIC iterations unrolled into one clock
cycle (two iterations for the major axis, and two for the minor axis).

In order to fit this into 2x2 TinyTapeout tiles, a lot of sacrifices were made;
for one, it doesn't have a multiplier so the ray steps are by approximate
orders of magnitude.

## How to test

Run clock at 48MHz, connect VGA and sound Pmods, and give it a reset pulse.
